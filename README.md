# APP NAME

This app is designed to increase the accessibility of the National Diabetic Prevention Program for pre-diabetic adults to reduce the onset of diabetes by deploying an automated chat bot solution that scales infinitely.

In the United States, more than 30 million Americans have diabetes. More than 84 million US adults—that’s 1 in 3—has prediabetes. The associated cost of diabetes is $327 billion. 

The National Diabetes Prevention Program—or National DPP—was created in 2010 by the CDC to address the increasing burden of pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes in the United States.

It is a research-based, structured lifestyle change program focusing on healthy eating and physical activity which showed that people with pre-diabetes who take part in it, cut their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58%.

It is 16-weeks long, instructor-led, and conversational-style which educates enrollees and helps them track and manage their health goals. It is worth noting that it also fully reimbursable. Currently there are hundreds of organizations nationwide implementing the program. Our app was designed to help the scalability constraints of the DPP for the vast majority of pre-diabetic individuals who may have trouble attneding one of these courses (in-person or online), and give them the flexiblity to take this course anytime, anywhere, without the need for human instructors.
